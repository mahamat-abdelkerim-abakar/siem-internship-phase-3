# Internship Project: Phase 3 - Network Security Monitoring Implementation

## Project Overview
During Phase 3 of my internship, I implemented a comprehensive network security monitoring solution using Elastic Stack on Windows infrastructure. This project focused on deploying Packetbeat to capture and analyze network traffic, detecting security threats in real-time, and creating actionable security intelligence through Kibana dashboards.

## Key Responsibilities & Achievements

### 1. Packetbeat Deployment on Windows
-  Successfully installed and configured Packetbeat as a Windows service
-  Integrated Npcap driver for efficient packet capture capabilities
-  Configured TLS-secured communication between Packetbeat and Elasticsearch
-  Implemented automated service recovery mechanisms for continuous monitoring

### 2. Security Configuration
-  Established secure communication channels using TLS 1.3
-  Configured service accounts with least-privilege access principles
-  Implemented credential management through Elasticsearch keystore
-  Set up comprehensive audit logging for security operations

### 3. Threat Detection Implementation
- ðŸ›¡ Developed detection rules for critical security scenarios:
  - **Port Scan Detection**: Identified reconnaissance activities through horizontal port scanning
  - **Data Exfiltration Monitoring**: Detected suspicious large data transfers to external systems
  - **Anomalous Network Patterns**: Established baselines for normal traffic and flagged deviations
-  Created MITRE ATT&CK-mapped detection content:
  - Technique TA0040: Discovery
  - Technique TA0010: Exfiltration

### 4. Kibana Dashboard Development
Designed and implemented three core security dashboards:

| Dashboard | Key Features |
|----------|-------------|
| **Network Security Overview** | - Real-time traffic monitoring<br>- Protocol distribution analysis<br>- Top talker identification |
| **Threat Detection Center** | - Alert timeline visualization<br>- Severity-based incident triaging<br>- MITRE ATT&CK technique mapping |
| **Geo Threat Intelligence** | - Source IP geolocation mapping<br>- Traffic volume heatmaps<br>- Suspicious country alerting |

### 5. Testing & Validation
-  Simulated attack scenarios to validate detection capabilities:
  - Port scanning using PowerShell automation
  - Data exfiltration through large file transfers
  - Anomalous connection patterns to high-risk countries
-  Documented detection efficacy and false positive rates
-  Optimized rules based on validation results

## Technical Environment
- **Operating System**: Windows Server 2022
- **Security Tools**: Elastic Stack 8.12 (Elasticsearch, Kibana)
- **Network Monitoring**: Packetbeat 8.12.2 with Npcap 1.75
- **Automation**: PowerShell scripting for deployment and testing
- **Security Standards**: TLS 1.3 encryption, RBAC controls

## Key Learnings
1. Practical experience with enterprise security monitoring tools
2. Network threat detection methodology and implementation
3. Security-as-Code practices for detection rule management
4. Windows service configuration and troubleshooting
5. Security visualization best practices for SOC operations
6. Attack simulation and detection validation techniques

## Project Impact
-   Established foundation for continuous network security monitoring
-   Reduced threat detection time from hours to minutes
-   Created reusable detection content mapped to MITRE ATT&CK framework
-   Developed operational documentation for ongoing security operations
-   Demonstrated practical application of security theory in enterprise environment
